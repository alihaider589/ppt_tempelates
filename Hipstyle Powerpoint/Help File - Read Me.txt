NO NEED SPECIAL TREATMENT BUT,
- IF YOU NEED TO EDIT THE BACKGROUND LAYOUT, GO TO VIEW TAB, SLIDEMASTER
  EDIT THE VERY TOP SLIDE, IT IS LAYOUT MASTER SLIDE, IF YOU EDIT THAT VERY TOP SLIDE ONLY, 
  ALL BACKGROUND LAYOUT WILL CHANGE AUTOMATICALLY

- DONT FORGET AFTER DRAGGING YOUR PICTURES INTO THE PICTURE PLACEHOLDER
  RIGHT CLICK ON YOUR PICTURES YOU HAVE DRAGGED, AND CLICK "SEND TO BACK"
  BECAUSE SOME OF THE SLIDES CONTAIN TRANSPARENT RECTANGLE.

- TO CHANGE COLOR JUST GO TO DESIGN>COLOR>AND SELECT YOUR FAVORITE COLOR

- SOME SHAPES AND PICTURES USE SHADOW TEQNIQUES. YOU CAN SET IT YOURSELF ON FORMAT SHAPE/FORMAT PICTURE

- IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE CIRCLE LAYOUT, JUST CLICK VIEW-SLIDE MASTER AND EDIT
  THE LAYOUT ON THE FIRST SLIDE (THE BIG SLIDE).

THANK YOU.
